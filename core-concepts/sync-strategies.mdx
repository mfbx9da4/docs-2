Unfortunately, webhooks aren’t always available. Many Third Party applications don’t support real time events. But rest assured, Panora has you covered! With our robust polling technology, our servers will automatically check for new records created/updated and proxy those changes to your application in near real-time.

## Periodic Sync

By default, for every single linked account that you may have, we sync all 3rd parties they've connected across all common models.
These sync jobs are done every 8 hours.
