### FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Panora speeds up the process of building integrations?">
    Panora reduces the amount of APIs you will need to interact with. Using a single endpoint, you will be able to read and write data from various CRMs, ticketing platforms. No need to go through endless cycles of documentation exploration, testing and maintaining.

<Accordion title="Am I limited to Panora's supported integrations?">
  No! Panora is extensible. We are open-source, and written in TypeScript.
  Building new connectors on top of Panora is fun and faster than building them
